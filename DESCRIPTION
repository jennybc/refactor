Title: Make Factors Less Annoying
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: Factors have driven people to extreme measures, like ordering
    custom conference ribbons and laptop stickers to express how HELLNO we
    feel about stringsAsFactors. And yet, sometimes you need them. Can they
    be made less maddening? Let's find out. This is a slightly more serious
    effort than the toy package, foofactors, created in STAT 545A. But only
    slightly. I just want to play with some of these functions for now ...
